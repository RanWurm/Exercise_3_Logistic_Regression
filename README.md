# Logistic Regression Exercise

## Overview

This project contains a Jupyter notebook that outlines the process of building and evaluating a logistic regression model. The notebook is designed as an educational tool to demonstrate logistic regression applied to a binary classification problem using a well-defined dataset.

## Project Description

### Objective

To understand and implement logistic regression to predict categorical outcomes effectively. The notebook includes detailed explanations and visualizations to aid in understanding the underlying mathematics and data manipulations.

### Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps for loading, cleaning, and preparing data for model training.
- **Model Training**: Implementation of logistic regression using Python's popular libraries.
- **Evaluation**: Detailed evaluation of the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Plots and charts to visualize the results and performance of the model.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Demonstrates how to adjust parameters to improve the model.

### Implementation Details

#### Data Handling

- The notebook utilizes Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- It includes methods for handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

#### Model Building

- Uses Scikit-learn to implement logistic regression.
- Demonstrates how to split data into training and testing sets to validate the model's performance.

#### Evaluation Metrics

- Discusses various metrics suitable for evaluating classification models and implements them using Scikit-learn.

### Usage

To use this notebook:

1. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or use platforms like Google Colab to run the notebook directly in the cloud.

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Make sure all dependencies are installed using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Run the Notebook: Open the Jupyter Notebook in your environment and run each cell sequentially to understand the workflow and results.

Experiment: Try modifying the data preprocessing steps, model parameters, or evaluation metrics to see how they affect the model's performance.
